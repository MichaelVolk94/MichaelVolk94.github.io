        <h2>Stenhouse Jr. claims 65th annual Daytona 500</h2>
        <img src="images/2022daytona500.jpg" alt="The 47 team after winning the Great American race">
        <div class="overflow">
        <p class="p-float">In the longest Daytona 500 in NASCAR history, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. came back from
            a speeding penalty and won stock car racing's most prestigious race when a wild wreck froze 
            the field in the second green-white-checkered finish.
            During the last lap of the race, Stenhouse and reigning NASCAR Cup Series champion Joey Logano 
            were battling for the lead when contact from Aric Almirola's Ford started Travis Pastrana's Toyota 
            spinning in Turn 2. Pastrana's Camry clipped the Chevrolet of Kyle Larson and set it rocketing into the outside wall, causing a huge wreck on
            the last lap involving many other cars, which led to the officals throwing out the caution
            which ended the race. But when NASCAR hit the button to illuminate the caution lights, Stenhouse's No. 47 JTG Daugherty Chevrolet 
            edged ahead of Logano's Ford, thanks to a timely shove from the third-place finishing Toyota of Christopher Bell, who, like Stenhouse, 
            arrived at the pinnacle of pavement racing from a dirt-track background.
            NASCAR declared Stenhouse the winner of the 65th running of the event, the first win for Stenhouse since 2017 at the summer Daytona race.
            “Man, this is unbelievable.“ Stenhouse said after climbing from his car.
            “This was the site of my last win back in 2017. We've worked really hard. We had a couple shots last year to get a win and fell short. 
            It was a tough season, but, man, we got it done. Daytona 500!”
            It was a remarkable victory and a perfect highlight for the 75th anniversary of NASCAR racing. Stenhouse is the first driver from a single-car team to win the Great American Race since 
            Trevor Bayne shocked the racing world with Wood Brothers Racing in 2011.
            The win was Stenhouse's third in the Cup Series and first since he took the checkered flag in the Daytona summer race in 2017, snapping a streak of 
            199 races without a victory. JTG Daugherty hadn't found Victory Lane since Allmendinger triumphed at Watkins Glen in 2014, a drought of 266 races.
