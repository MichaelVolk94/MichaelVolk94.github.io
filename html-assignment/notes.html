    <dl>
        <dt>!DOCTYPE</dt>
        <dd>This tag defines the document type. What I've learned is how important it is to 
            use it every time you start an html code. In order to start making you're website,
            you must put an exclaimation mark in order to get the document working.</dd>

        <dt>p</dt>
        <dd>This tag defines a paragraph. Browsers always add a blank line before and after each paragraph.
What I've learned about this tag is that it's very important to put paragraphs on websites to make the website
look more clean and not messy.</dd>

<dt>section</dt>
<dd>This tag defines a section in a document. What I've learned about this tag 
    is that this tag creates a seperate section of a document, which proceeds after the heading tag.</dd>
