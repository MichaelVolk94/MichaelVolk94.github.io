                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I have numerous hobbies that I enjoy doing in my spare time.
I like to make drawings on the computer. I discvered that talent when I was in a computer course in my first year of high school.
It was hard at first, but as time went on, I was able to figure how to make drawings on Corel.
As I kept using Corel during my time in High School, I was enjoying making drawings more and more as I gained experience with the program, that it evantually
turned into a hobby. As I came into college, I now use Illustrator, and I'm just as much fun making drawings as I did back then. </p>
<p>Another hobby that I'm into is that I like to play music. I discovered my liking for music when the music
teacher opened the music room during lunch, and what I discovered is that music is my happy place, and it reduced my stress levels.
I first learned how to play the ukelele in music class, then when I was in high school, I started to play the guitar and even joined the school band.
Where I learned to play the bass clarinet. I participated in band class in all of my high school years,
as by the time I was in my graduation year, the teacher said I was a very important piece in the school band, because
I was the only bass player. At first in my junior year, it was a very hard instrument to play, considering that the first experiences 
with the instrument we're loud noises, but as time went on, I got better and I was able to play the much more difficult songs. 
Overall, it was a fun experience, and it helped reduce my stress levels since playing music helped me relax.
